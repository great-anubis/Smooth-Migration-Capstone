# Training Report - Week 5

## Date:
4/24/25

## Overview:
This report documents the progress made during Week 5 for the Smooth Migration Mobile App AI model. The focus was on finalizing the AI-generated checklist, ensuring valid JSON output from the baseline model, and setting up integration stubs for the upcoming integration phase.

## 1. AI Model Output
- **Objective:** Generate a migration checklist divided into three phases: Pre-Departure, Departure, and Post-Departure.
- **Output Format:** Valid JSON with each phase mapping to a list of tasks.
- **Observations:**  
  - The baseline model now returns valid JSON with no markdown formatting.
  - Sample tasks include visa application, flight booking, etc.
- **Issues & Resolutions:**  
  - JSON parsing errors were resolved by updating the prompt and stripping markdown code blocks.

## 2. Checklist Mapping File
- **File:** `scripts/checklist_mapping.json`
- **Contents:**  
  - Mapped API triggers such as `visa_application`, `flight_booking`, `bank_account`, etc.
- **Observations:**  
  - The mapping file was validated using a dedicated Python script.

## 3. Integration Stub Endpoints
- **File:** `src/app/api.py`
- **Endpoint:** `/recommendations`
- **Functionality:**  
  - Returns a simulated checklist and the mapping details.
- **Testing:**  
  - Verified via cURL / Postman, and integration tests were conducted using the `baseline_training.ipynb` notebook.
  
## 4. Automation Script
- **File:** `scripts/run_baseline_training.bat`
- **Functionality:**  
  - Automates the activation of the virtual environment, running the baseline model, and mapping file validation.
- **Observations:**  
  - The script runs successfully and provides instructions for further integration testing.

## 5. Next Steps
- Integration of the AI model with the mobile app's full stack in Week 6.
- Continued refinement of checklist mapping based on real API endpoints.
- Ongoing monitoring and testing based on integration feedback.
